# Importing Javascript Functions Into WebAssembly

## Overview

When you are instantiating Wasm modules, you are able to pass in an [`importObject`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/instantiateStreaming). This `importObject` can be used to call host (Javascript) functions within Wasm!

In rust, tools like [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen), which is part of wasm-pack workflow, abstracts away the `importObject`.

In this example, we will import and implement a simple `console.log` which is called within Wasm. This example is inspired by the [console_log example ](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/blob/master/examples/console_log/src/lib.rs), but simplified. So let's jump into the example:

---

## Implementation

First, let's add the following to our `src/lib.rs` file:

```rust
// Add the wasm-pack crate
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

// Let's define our external function (imported from JS)
// Here, we will define our external `console.log`
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern "C" {
  // Use `js_namespace` here to bind `console.log(..)` instead of just
  // `log(..)`
#[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = console)]
  fn log(s: &str);
}

// Export a function that will be called in JavaScript
// but call the "imported" console.log.
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn console_log_from_wasm() {
  log("This console.log is from wasm!");
}
```

Then, let's compile that using [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack), which will create a `pkg/` directory:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

Next, lets create an `index.js` file to load and run our wasm output. Let's import the wasm initialization module from `pkg/importing_javascript_functions_into_webassembly.js` that was generated by wasm-pack. Then, let's call the module passing in the path to our wasm file at `pkg/importing_javascript_functions_into_webassembly_bg.wasm` that was generated by wasm-pack. Then, we will go ahead and call our exported wasm function, that will call the "imported" `console.log` JavaScript function:

```javascript
const runWasm = async () => {
  // Instantiate our wasm module
  const rustWasm = await wasmInit(
    "./pkg/importing_javascript_functions_into_webassembly_bg.wasm"
  );

  // Run the exported function
  rustWasm.console_log_from_wasm(); // Should log "This console.log is from wasm!"
};
runWasm();
```

Lastly, lets load our ES6 Module, `index.js` Javascript file in our `index.html`. And you should get something similar to the demo ([Source Code](/source-redirect?path=examples/importing-javascript-functions-into-webassembly/demo/rust)) below!

And that's it for the basics! Next, lets took a look at some "Advanced Web Demos", with an example of implementing [Graphics with WebAssembly](/example-redirect?exampleName=graphics).
