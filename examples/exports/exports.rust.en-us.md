# Exports

## Overview

In our [Hello World Example](/example-redirect?exampleName=hello-world), we called a function exported from WebAssembly, in our Javascript. Let's dive a little deeper into exports and how they are used.

## Implementation

If you haven't done so already, you should set up your project following the steps laid out in the [Hello World Example](/example-redirect?exampleName=hello-world) example.

First, let's add the following to our `src/lib.rs` file:

```typescript
// Add the wasm-pack crate
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

// This exports an add function.
// It takes in two 32-bit integer values
// And returns a 32-bit integer value.
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn callMeFromJavascript(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
  return addIntegerWithConstant(a, b);
}

// A NOT exported constant
// Rust does not support exporting constants
// for Wasm (that I know of).
const ADD_CONSTANT: i32 = 24;

// A NOT exported function
// It takes in two 32-bit integer values
// And returns a 32-bit integer value.
fn addIntegerWithConstant(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
  return a + b + ADD_CONSTANT;
}
```

Then, let's compile that using [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack), which will create a `pkg/` directory:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

Next, lets create an `index.js` file to load and run our wasm output. Let's import the wasm initialization module from `pkg/exports.js` that was generated by wasm-pack. Then, let's call the module passing in the path to our wasm file at `pkg/exports_bg.wasm` that was generated by wasm-pack. Then, let's go ahead and call out exported functions, and explore what functions were NOT exported:

```javascript
import wasmInit from "./pkg/exports.js";

const runWasm = async () => {
  // Instantiate our wasm module
  const rustWasm = await wasmInit("./pkg/exports_bg.wasm");

  // Call the Add function export from wasm, save the result
  const result = rustWasm.callMeFromJavascript(24, 24);

  console.log(result); // Should output '72'
  console.log(rustWasm.ADD_CONSTANT); // Should output 'undefined'
  console.log(rustWasm.addIntegerWithConstant); // Should output 'undefined'
};
runWasm();
```

Lastly, lets load our ES6 Module, `index.js` Javascript file in our `index.html`. And you should get something similar to the demo ([Source Code](/source-redirect?path=examples/exports/demo/rust)) below!
