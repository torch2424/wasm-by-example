        Wasm By Example is a concise, hands-on introduction to WebAssembly using
        code snippets and annotated WebAssembly example programs. If you "learn
        best by doing", or just need a good starting point for a concept, this
        is the place for you. Wasm By Example offers wasm examples in multiple
        programming / written languages, where the languages are available for
        the example. Browse the list of wasm examples below.
